# Arduino Starter Project - Binary Dice

## Description
In this project I'm going to make a binary dice using some LEDs and switches on a breadboard connected to an Arduino Uno. This project is ideal for beginners who have grasped the basics of Arduino programming and prototyping but wish to learn something a little more advanced. Enjoy!

###### Project Requirements
* Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
* USB cable to program Arduino
* Breadboard
* Three LEDS (Any colours will do)
* Three 220 Ohm Resistors
* Two 1k Resistors
* Two Pushbuttons
* Wires to power the components on the breadboard

###### The Breadboard Setup

Makes use of the Bounce2 library:

Largely based on a project in the Arduino Quick-Start Guide by Maik Schmidt
